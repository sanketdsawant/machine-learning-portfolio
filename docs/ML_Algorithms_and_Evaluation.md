# 🧠 Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine Learning algorithms are typically categorized into the following types:

## 1. Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled data (input → known output)
- Goal: Predict outcomes for new data
- 📌 Example Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Learns from **unlabeled data**
- Goal: Find hidden patterns or groupings
- 📌 Example Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Hierarchical Clustering

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
- Mix of labeled and unlabeled data
- Often used when labeling is expensive
- 📌 Example Use: Image classification with few labeled samples

## 4. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns through rewards and penalties in an environment
- 📌 Example Use: Game-playing AI, robotics, self-driving cars

# 📏 Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning

Evaluating a model’s performance is crucial to choosing the best algorithm. Common metrics include:

## For Classification
- **Accuracy** – % of correct predictions
- **Precision** – How many predicted positives are truly positive
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** – How many actual positives were predicted correctly
- **F1 Score** – Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix** – Table showing TP, FP, FN, TN

## For Regression
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**
