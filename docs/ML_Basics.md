# 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn patterns from historical data and make decisions or predictions **without being explicitly programmed**.

Just like humans learn through experience, ML systems learn from data.

## 📌 Real-World Examples
- **Email Spam Filter**: Learns from past emails to detect spam automatically.
- **Online Shopping**: Recommends products based on user behavior.
- **Loan Approval**: Predicts risk based on applicant data.

# 🔍 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

| Type               | Description                                  | Input Data       | Example Use Case                      | Example Algorithms                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Supervised**     | Learns from labeled data (input + output)    | Labeled          | Email classification, loan prediction | Linear Regression, Decision Trees   |
| **Unsupervised**   | Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data      | Unlabeled        | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection | K-Means, PCA, Clustering          |
